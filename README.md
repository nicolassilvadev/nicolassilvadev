### Hey there, how's it going? 👋 I'm Nicolas

I'm a Software Engineer with just over 5 years of experience in full stack development, currently focused on back-end.

My main stack is Node.js with TypeScript/JavaScript, and I also work with Python, messaging systems, databases, and solid architecture principles. These days, I'm especially interested in back-end projects involving scalability and performance.
